      <li>CSF and NHS</li>
      <p>As part of the school, I am involved in both California Scholarship Foundation (CSF) and National Honor Society (NHS). Both clubs are meant to provide volunteer opportunities to students to allow us to do community service. With these clubs, I have volunteered many times. I have volunteered at food banks, helping package and handout food, as well as many events where I have to help with the setup and clean up. The most recent event I have done has been where I helped setup for a Chirstmas event, as well as passing out cookies, then helping with cleanup at the end.</p>
      <li>Peer Counseling</li>
      <p>This year, I have joined Peer Counseling. We do lots of team building, encouraging working in groups and cooperation. More importantly than that, we provide free tutoring to all students at Rancho Bernardo. Personally, I tend to tutor kids who ask for help in math and science as those are my stronger subjects. I have tutored for over 20 hours in total, and I have also helped in volunteer events that they setup.</p>
