    <p class="intro">Below are just a few of the many projects I have created using python!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>TicTacToe</li>

        <img src="Leaderboard.png" alt="TTTLeaderboard">
        <p>For this project, I used turtles and images to create the board and the X and O pieces. In order to create the leaderboard, I made the boxes using a turtle, and the counters are made so they automatically go up each time a player wins. To place a piece, the terminal asks the player to pick a number 1-9, where one is the top left, and it goes top to bottom left to right, just like a book. The program alternates placing X's and O's, and once a player has gotten 3-in-a-row, it places a line through it and updates the leaderboard.
      <li>Catch a Turtle</li>

          <p>In this project, called Catch a Turtle, the objective of the game is to click the turtle as many times as possible in 30 seconds! The timer starts once the player clicks the turtle once, and counts down to 30. Each time the player clicks the turtle, the turtle changes to a random position, using the rand function. This adds challenge to the game. Each time the turtle is clicked, the counter updates, increasing by one each time.</p>
      <li>GUI With Buttons</li>

      <p>In this project, we created a GUI in python with working buttons. In order to use the buttons, the user must enter a valid URL in the specified box. When clicked, each button will run a seperate code to identify the ping, trace the route, and identify the IP Address. The last button is to save the information as a file to your computer. We were able to customize the font, alter the color of the GUI, adjust the size of the boxes, and the design of the buttons.</p>
